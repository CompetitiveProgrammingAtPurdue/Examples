#Contributing
When contributing, please attempt to make examples minimal while still giving a complete implementation.  
The file structure is ~/<Weekly_Subject>/<Language>/<Concept_title>.c  
We are sticking to examples in C, C++, Java, and Python. Please try to comment every line.  
The goal is to make it as clear as possible so students can refer back to this until they get it on their own.
